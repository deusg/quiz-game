# Quiz Game

# Description:
A simple Python program that asks the user a fixed number of questions on any topic and then gives them a score depending on how many are correct. Use a list for the questions and a list for the corresponding answers.

# How to Play:

You'll be presented with a series of questions, each with multiple-choice options or requiring a direct answer.
Input your answer when prompted.
If your answer is correct, you'll receive immediate feedback, earning points for each correct answer.
If your answer is incorrect, don't worry! The correct answer will be revealed, allowing you to learn as you play.
At the end of the game, your total score will be displayed, reflecting the number of questions you answered correctly.

# Credits
This project was inspired by the book "Creative Coding in Python" (Chapter 3, Page 79).
